# Welcome to my Profile!
## My name is Henry Barth

### I am a civil engineering student who has a passion for programming.
The civil engineering and construction industry in general tend to lag behind other industries when it comes to innovation and adoption of new technologies
I want to change that by using computer science skills to improve the industry and make work more efficient.
