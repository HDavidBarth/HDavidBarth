# Welcome to my Profile!
## My name is Henry Barth

### I am an aspiring Structural Engineer
The civil engineering and construction industry in general seem to lag behind other industries when it comes to innovation and adoption of new technologies.
I want to use computer science and programming skills to build efficient tools that will help me and my collaborators stand apart from the crownd.
