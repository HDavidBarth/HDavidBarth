# Welcome to my Profile!
## My name is Henry Barth

### I am a civil engineering student who has discovered programming and has fallen in love with it.
My goal is to apply computer science to the field of civil engineering in order to solve problems more efficiently and quickly.

My wife and I have a beautiful baby boy who is now 5 months old. Time really flies!
